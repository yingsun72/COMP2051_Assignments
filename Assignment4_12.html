<!Set the first two elements to zero, since 0 and 1 are not prime. Starting with array subscript2, every time 
an array element is found whose value is 1, loop through the remainder of the array and set to zero every 
element whose subscript is a multiple of the subscript for the element with value 1. For array subscript 2, 
all elements beyond 2 in the array that are multiples of 2 will be set to zero (subscripts 4, 6, 8, 10, etc.); 
for array subscript 3, all elements beyond 3 in the array that are multiples of 3 will be set to zero 
(subscripts 6, 9, 12, 15, etc.); and so on. When this process is complete, the array elements that are still 
set to 1 indicate that the subscript is a prime number. These subscripts can then be printed.Write a script 
that uses an array of 1000 elements to determine and print the prime numbers between 1 and 999. Ignore element 
0 of the array.>
