<!A parking garage charges a $2.00 minimum fee to park for up to three hours. The garage charges an 
additional $0.50 per hour for each hour or part thereof in excess of three hours. The maximum charge 
for any given 24-hour period is $10.00. Assume that no car parks for longer than 24 hours at a time. 
Write a script that calculates and displays the parking charges for each customer who parked a car in 
this garage yesterday. You should input from the user the hours parked for each customer. The program 
should display the charge for the current customer and should calculate and display the running total of 
yesterday's receipts. The program should use the function calculate-Charges to determine the charge 
for each customer. Use a text input field to obtain the input from the user.>
