<!(Nested Control Statement) A college offers a course that prepares students for the state licensing exam 
for real estate brokers. Last year, several of the students who completed this course took the licensing
exam. Naturally, the college wants to know how well its students performed. You have been asked to 
write a program to summarize the results. You have been given a list of these 10 students. Next to each 
name is written a 1 if the student passed the exam and a 2 if the student failed. Your program should 
analyze the results of the exam as follows:
a. Input each test result (i.e., a 1 or a 2). Display the message “Enter result” on the screen each 
time the program requests another test result.
b. Count the number of test results of each type.
c. Display a summary of the test results indicating the number of students who passed and the 
number of students who failed.
d. If more than eight students passed the exam, print the message Raise tuition.
