<!A company wants to transmit data over the telephone, but it is concerned that its phones 
may be tapped. All of its data is transmitted as four-digit integers. It has asked you to 
write a program that will encrypt its data so that the data may be transmitted more securely. 
Your script should read a four-digit integer entered by the user in a prompt dialog and encrypt
it as follows: Replace each digit by (the sum of that digit plus 7) modulus 10. Then swap the 
first digit with the third, and swap the second digit with the fourth. Then output text that 
displays the encrypted integer. Once this is done, write a program that inputs an encrypted 
four-digit integer and decrypts it to form the original number.
