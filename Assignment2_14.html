<!A person invests $1000.00 in a savings account yielding 5 percent interest. Assuming that 
all the interest is left on deposit, calculate and print the amount of money in the account 
at the end of each year for 10 years. Use the following formula to determine the amounts:
a. a = p * (1 + r)n where p is the original amount invested (i.e., the principal), r is the 
annual interest rate, n is the number of years, a is the amount on deposit at the end of the
nth year.
b. Create a program which puts the value of the amount on deposit every year for the next 10 
years, as well as the count of the year, in a table.
