An employer wants you to create a program that will allow her to enter each employeeâ€™s name, hourly 
rate of pay, number of hours worked in one week, overtime pay rate, payroll deductions (such as 
medical insurance, savings, etc.), and tax rate. The program should output the employees gross pay 
(before taxes and deductions), and net pay (after taxes and deductions) for each employee for one 
week.
